UI panel which displays current artist's country on the world map and lets you generate autoplaylists based on selection and locale tag saving when integrated along WilB's Biography Scritp.

The map uses locale tag (*) from the tracks currently playing or on selection (*). 
It may be a tag name or a TF expression, and may contain ISO values (ARG) or full names (Argentina). 
Capitalization doesn't matter. Full names are converted to ISO values before coordinates lookup.
Tag may be fetched using any of these 3 method (on this order):
- Tags from tracks.
- Tags from JSON data file (if available).
- Tags from WilB's Biography Script (if enabled). (*) (**) (***)

When tags are not available on the tracks, they can be written on the files theirselves or on the JSON data file (*), using the info shared by Biography Script.
Note that once the JSON file contains some artist's data, internet connection -and thus Biography Script too- is no longer needed... acting as a local database for the tags related to those artists.

Panel is updated when playback changes, switching playlists, selecting tracks, ... and requires a full world map using Mercator projection to work. One is given for convenience, but can be changed if desired at properties.

(*) Configurable.
(**) Requires a modified version of the script. It may be installed manually or using the appropiate menu, which automatically adds the required code to the original script.
- 1.2.X: 'Notify tags' must be enabled on Bio's config panel too. When doing an automatic installation, it will be automatically enabled too.
(***) Manual installation requires adding this line at THE END of WilB's Biography Script (or the panel where it's loaded):
- 1.1.X: (there is only one file)
	include(fb.ProfilePath + 'scripts\\SMP\\xxx-scripts\\helpers\\biography_mod_1_1_X_xxx.js');
- 1.2.X: (to '.\scripts\callbacks.js') (look at '.\profile\foo_spider_monkey_panel\packages\{BA9557CE-7B4B-4E0E-9373-99F511E81252}')
	include(fb.ProfilePath + 'scripts\\SMP\\xxx-scripts\\helpers\\biography_mod_1_2_X_xxx.js');

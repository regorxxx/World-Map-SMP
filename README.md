A [foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org) UI [Spider Monkey Panel](https://theqwertiest.github.io/foo_spider_monkey_panel)/[JSplitter](https://foobar2000.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6378) which displays current artist's country on the world map and lets you generate autoplaylists based on selection and locale tag saving when integrated along [WilB's Biography Script](https://github.com/Wil-B/Biography).

* Map image configurable:
  * Full.
  * No Antarctica.
  * Custom. (coordinates may need a transformation to work)
* Configurable X and Y factors for transformation (along custom image maps).
* 2 modes:
  * Standard: Follow now playing track or selection.
  * Library: display statistics of entire library (independtly of the selection/playback).
* Works with multiple selected tracks (draws all points on the map), allowing to show statistics of an entire playlist or library.
* On playback the panel fetches tags from (by order of preference):
  * Track's tags.
  * Json database.
  * WilB's Biography panel.
* WilB's Biography integration (1.1.X or 1.2.0+):
  * [1.1.X](https://hydrogenaud.io/index.php?topic=112913.msg977224#msg977224): Done via script. There is a menu option to install the mod (it looks for the original file, edits the relevant lines and creates a backup). Is done step by step and can be reverted back.
  * [1.2.0+](https://hydrogenaud.io/index.php?topic=112913.msg1001097#msg1001097): Works automatically without requiring further action.
  * Selection mode changes automatically when changing it on Biography panel, therefore syncing the changes.
  * Biography lets you write tags on demand, this lets you write tags as soon as the panel gets refreshed with new data.
* Tool-tip shows multiple info about the points and tracks selected.
* AutoPlaylist creation:
   * On click over a point, an autoplaylist is created with any artist on your library from the selected country.
   * Ctrl modifier: forces an autoplaylist  with artist from selected country AND same tags (2 configurable). Currently set to style and genre.
